# DistributeWorkLoad
Distribute workload to staff
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mymodule.ipynb               : Jupyter notebook file that contains Python codes, which is a module. 
IKFA_Final_Strike_Ever.ipynb : Jupyter notebook file that contains Python codes, which is the main program. 
Log_14-05-2019_21-37-37.txt  : This is one of the output files. This is similar to a log file, which contains all operations info. 
Run the py file - home.txt   : This file is a trivial file actually. This is just an instruction flat file for developer.
Run the py file - office.txt : This file is a trivial file actually. This is just an instruction flat file for developer.
Gecmis.xlsx                  : This file is one of the input files. It contains all past assignments.
Girdi.xlsx                   : This file is one of the input files. It contains raw input.
Personel.xlsx                : This file is one of the input files. It contains personal name only.

    This Python code assigns workload to personal according to the past assignments and personal file.
These iterative operations are run with the following rules:
    - Each workload (or each of the workloads) is indivisible...
    - Each workload has to be dealt out to one of the staff completely...
    - Each Workload is expected to deal out to the same worker who was responsible for it before...
    - Workloads are fairly divided among staff as much as possible...

Project : Learning Python and Pandas especially.
Input   :  Three Excel (or csv) files...
Output  :  One Excel file... (and a log flat file (.txt))

Please note that some output files are now missing and these files will be added when the program is finished.
